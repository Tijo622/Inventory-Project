The hotel chain operates bars across multiple locations and is struggling with:

Stockouts of high-demand beverage items, leading to poor guest experiences and lost revenue

Overstocking of slow-moving inventory, resulting in high storage costs and wastage

The business needs a reliable system to forecast weekly item-level demand and recommend optimal inventory levels (par levels) to balance supply and demand efficiently. Solving this issue enhances operational efficiency and guest satisfaction while minimizing costs.

Performance:

Successfully forecasts weekly demand for most items

Filters out items with insufficient data to avoid unreliable predictions

Recommends safety-stock-inclusive par levels for weekly restocking

Improvements:

Detect and model seasonality for high-volume brands

Incorporate event calendars, weather, or holiday data if available

Add supply chain constraints (e.g., lead time, storage capacity)

Switch to multi-item or joint forecasting for shared logistics
